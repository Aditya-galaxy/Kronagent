Promotion evidence: how often would this action class have been wrong?

Promoting an action class to autonomous execution has been a judgement: an
operator gives a reason, and the reason is audited. Shadow mode already holds
something better than a reason. For every finding it records what Kronagent
planned, and `outcome.py record` stores what the team decided. Put together,
they answer the question a promotion is really asking:

    Of the findings where Kronagent would have run this action unattended,
    how many did the team judge benign, or choose not to contain?

That count gives a bound, not just a rate. With `n` scored findings and `k` of
them unwarranted, the exact binomial upper bound says: "with 95% confidence,
fewer than X% of these actions would have been wrong." Twenty clean findings
sound convincing and only show the rate is below 14%. Fifty-nine show it is
below 5%. The number of findings a promotion needs follows from the error the
operator will accept, and this module says how many are still missing.

What counts, and what does not:

  * Only findings the triage model itself called actionable. A finding the
    model dismissed and the severity floor (or the structured-fields recheck)
    sent to a person is forced to approval whatever the allowlist says, so a
    promotion would never run it unattended.
  * Only planned actions on a provider the promotion would cover.
  * **Unwarranted** is conservative in both directions: the analyst's verdict
    was benign, *or* the team took no containment action. Either one means an
    unattended action would have done something nobody chose.
  * Findings with no recorded outcome, or an inconclusive one, are left out and
    counted, never treated as agreement.

What the bound does not cover, stated wherever it is shown:

  * An outcome is recorded per finding, not per action. "The team contained
    it" does not say they would have used this exact action.
  * The bound assumes next month's findings resemble the ones scored. An
    attacker who knows a class is autonomous can change what arrives. That is
    why a promotion still carries an owner and an expiry: the evidence earns
    the autonomy, the expiry makes it be earned again.
  * Evidence is per tenant and per provider. It is not yet per AWS account.

Nothing here changes a decision on a finding. It reads records already written.
