Threat Intelligence Agent — the first specialist beyond triage.

Where the triage agent answers "is this a real threat" (a yes/no gate), the
threat-intel agent answers "what IS this" — it maps the finding to MITRE ATT&CK
tactics/techniques, assesses the observed indicators of compromise, and places
the activity in the attack lifecycle. This is what upgrades an entry in the log
from "an alert" to "an analyst's assessment," and it enriches the context a human
sees when approving containment.

Design constraints (from agent-team-architecture.md — non-negotiable):
  * PURELY ADVISORY. This agent adds ZERO execution authority. Its output never
    touches a policy decision, never selects a containment target, never picks an
    action class. It only annotates the incident record and the approval context.
    So even a fully attacker-controlled response here cannot cause an action.
  * Reasons over the NORMALIZED finding, never raw telemetry — same
    prompt-injection discipline as triage.
  * Degrades gracefully: if the LLM is unavailable, enrichment is simply absent
    and the pipeline proceeds unchanged. Intelligence is a bonus, never a
    dependency.

Cost note: this runs only for findings triage already deemed actionable AND that
have candidate containment actions — i.e. the ones heading toward a human
decision, where enrichment has value. Most findings in a real stream are noise
and never reach this agent, so we don't pay per-finding intel cost on them. The
architecture permits running triage and intel in parallel; we sequence them
deliberately so intel cost is only incurred when it will actually inform a
decision.
