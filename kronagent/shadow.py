"""
Shadow mode: what Kronagent would have done, against what the team did.

The roadmap is blunt about why this matters. Shadow mode is the only honest way
to earn the right to execute, and it produces the strongest thing Kronagent can
show anyone: a number, from the customer's own environment, that Kronagent did
not choose. The offline evaluation gate cannot be that number — it runs over
synthetic cases, and its triage F1 is ~100% by construction.

This module builds the number without inflating it. Kronagent's side comes from
the audit log, which already records a triage verdict for *every* finding —
including the ones triage dismissed, which never reach an approval queue and so
would be invisible to any comparison built from approvals alone. The team's side
comes from `outcomes.py`.

What it refuses to do, each asserted in tests/test_shadow.py:

  - count a finding with no recorded outcome as agreement;
  - score an "inconclusive" outcome either way;
  - credit the triage model for an attack the severity floor rescued from its
    dismissal — that is a model miss the safeguard caught, and reported as one;
  - truncate the list of disagreements. The report is only worth publishing with
    its losses, so it always carries every one.

Nothing here changes a decision. It reads records already written.
