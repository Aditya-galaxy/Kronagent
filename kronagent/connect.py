"""
Tenant cloud connection: how a customer grants Kronagent access to their own
account, and how that grant is verified before anything relies on it.

Until now Kronagent read AWS credentials from its own process environment, which
only works when the platform runs inside the account it defends. That is a
developer setup. A customer cannot hand over an access key, and should not be
asked to.

The mechanism here is the one every serious cloud security vendor converged on:
a **cross-account IAM role, assumed with an External ID, created from a
CloudFormation template the customer launches from a pre-filled console link.**
No key ever changes hands, nothing long-lived is copied anywhere, and the
customer can read the exact permissions before granting them.

Two properties are load-bearing:

  1. **Read and write are separate grants.** Onboarding installs the *observe*
     role only: Kronagent ingests, triages, investigates and writes a full
     incident record while being structurally incapable of containment, because
     it does not hold the permissions. Containment is a second, deliberate stack
     the customer installs later. This is the product's whole thesis expressed
     as an IAM boundary rather than a claim — and it is the answer to the first
     objection every buyer raises.

  2. **The External ID is per tenant and secret.** It defends against the
     confused-deputy problem: without it, anyone who learns a customer's role
     ARN could ask *our* platform to assume it. AWS's guidance is explicit that
     the vendor generates it and the customer pins their trust policy to it.
