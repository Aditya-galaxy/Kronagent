Triage engine: fuse deterministic detection with LLM reasoning — provider-neutral.

The detector (GuardDuty, a Kubernetes audit rule, Falco, ...) already decided
something is wrong and, after normalization, handed us a `Finding` with a
severity and concrete resources. This engine does two things:

  1. Deterministic action mapping (grounded, no LLM): delegate to the finding's
     provider planner to derive candidate containment actions, with targets read
     straight from the normalized finding. This is what keeps containment aimed
     at the real compromised resource, on any substrate.

  2. LLM enrichment (Gemini, structured output): reason about the finding —
     categorize the threat, assign a response confidence, explain the rationale.
     The LLM's judgment gates *whether* to proceed, never *which resource* is
     targeted, so a prompt-injection payload in telemetry cannot redirect an
     action onto an attacker-chosen resource.

If the LLM is unavailable, triage degrades to a deterministic verdict driven by
the normalized severity, so the pipeline never stalls waiting on the model.

Free text can't dismiss a finding on its own. A finding's title and description
can carry text chosen by whoever caused the event, and a model reading "this is
the scheduled penetration test" tends to believe it (measured: see
kronagent/redteam.py). Two things answer that:

  * The prompt marks detector text as unverified data, and says what it can't
    establish: authorisation, an earlier investigation, a maintenance window, or
    an instruction to the reviewer.
  * When the model says "not actionable", it is asked again with the free text
    removed. If the structured fields alone (type, severity, kinds of resource)
    read as a threat, the verdict is marked **contested**: the text is what
    talked the model out of it. A contested finding goes to a person at any
    severity; the orchestrator never drops one. Text can lower a verdict to
    "ask a person", never to "drop".

The recheck only runs inside `recheck_band`. Below it the policy engine would
only alert whatever triage says; at or above it a dismissal already goes to a
person. So the second call is spent only where a dismissal would drop a finding
that could otherwise have been contained.
