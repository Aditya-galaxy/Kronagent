# Kronagent — Use Cases

*What Kronagent actually does, on three findings you have probably already seen.*

Each scenario below follows the same shape: the finding that arrives, what
responding to it looks like by hand, and what Kronagent does instead — including
where the policy engine stops and waits for you. The trust boundary is part of
the use case, not a footnote to it.

All three run today against replayed real-schema findings in
[`samples/`](../samples). `./demo.sh` walks them end to end.

## 1. Leaked access key

**Finding:** `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration.OutsideAWS`
— instance credentials are being used from outside AWS.

**By hand.** You wake up. Work out which key. Disable it in IAM. Then remember
that disabling a key does not kill sessions already issued from it, so revoke
those too. Then open CloudTrail and reconstruct what the key touched while you
were asleep.

**With Kronagent.** Triage confirms a real credential compromise; threat intel
maps it to ATT&CK T1078. Two actions follow — `disable_access_key` and
`revoke_role_sessions` — and the CloudTrail narrative of what the principal
touched is assembled into the incident record while that happens.

**Where it stops.** Both actions are reversible and scoped to a single
principal, so both are eligible for auto-execute once an operator has promoted
them. Nothing else in the account is touched. Before promotion, both route to
`approve.py` and wait.

## 2. Crypto miner on a production EC2 instance

**Finding:** `CryptoCurrency:EC2/BitcoinTool.B!DNS` — an instance is resolving
mining-pool domains.

**By hand.** You know you should kill the box. You also know that terminating it
destroys the evidence, and it is in a production ASG, so killing it may page
someone else. So you sit there at 3am, deciding.

**With Kronagent.** Forensics snapshots the EBS volume first, with chain of
custody recorded, so the evidence survives whatever happens next. Then
`isolate_instance_sg` moves the instance into a pre-provisioned quarantine
security group: network access severed, instance still running and still
inspectable.

**Where it stops.** Quarantine is reversible, so it can auto-execute.
`terminate_instance` is classified destructive and **cannot** run unattended
regardless of allowlist state — promoting it by mistake has no effect. It waits
for a human, with the snapshot already taken.

## 3. Compromised pod in a Kubernetes cluster

**Finding:** a Kubernetes audit event showing a pod executing unexpected
binaries and reaching an external address.

**By hand.** `kubectl delete pod` is muscle memory, but the controller
reschedules it and you have destroyed the evidence in exchange for nothing. The
correct move is to isolate it, which means writing a NetworkPolicy at 3am.

**With Kronagent.** Pod logs and the manifest are preserved first. Then
`isolate_pod` applies a deny-all NetworkPolicy over the pod: cut off from the
network, still running, still inspectable, and the controller reschedules
nothing.

**Where it stops.** Isolation is reversible and auto-eligible. `delete_pod` and
`scale_deployment_zero` are destructive and always require human approval.

## The pattern

Across all three: evidence is preserved before anything is contained, the
reversible action runs, and the irreversible one waits for a person. Every
decision along the way — triage, policy, approval, containment — is one entry in
the hash-chained audit log, so the whole sequence is reconstructable afterwards.

See [`agent-team-architecture.md`](../agent-team-architecture.md) for why the
policy engine, and not the model, makes every one of these calls.
